## Correlation is an association
- link/relationship/dependency/similarity between two or more variables
- both variables must be numeric
- **avoid claiming causation**

## Strength of the correlation
The Strength of the correlation is measured by the correlation coefficient, which:
- quantifies the strength of the association between numeric data
- ranges from -1 to +1
- sign only indicates if the dependency is positive or negative
- the absolute value (between 0 and 1) indicates the strength of the relationship

## Correlation coefficient CAN TELL:
- can tell the sign of the dependency (positive / negative relationship)
- can tell the strength of the relationship (regardless of underlying reasons)

## Correlation coefficient DOES NOT:
- does not work with non-linear data
- does not tell if there is a relationship or not
  - but rather how strong it is
- does not prove that change in one variable CAUSES change in another variable
  - **so correlation is not causation**
- does not tell the direction of the dependency
  - i.e. which variable is dependent and which one is independent
- does not detect if two variables we're looking at do not depend on each other at all
  - they could rather depend on another, third variable, which hasn't been even included into the model 
- does not exclude the possibility that two variables that seem to follow the same trend is pure coincidence
- does not tell the shape of data
  - completely different distributions can produce identical coefficient

## To summarise:
Correlation coefficient only tells is two variables follow the same trend/pattern – regardless of the underlying reasons/dependency/randomness

However, it does not specify the direction of the dependency (if there is such dependency) – so correlation is not causation
