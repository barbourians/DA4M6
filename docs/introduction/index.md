# Introduction to Statistics - Theory

## Sample vs Population
### Population
- full dataset
- absolutely all the data points required to answer your question

### Sample
- subset of population

Note: Having population is extremely rare:
- Unreasonably expensive
- Not even possible at all

## Good and bad samples
### Good
- representative
### Bad
- non-representative

## Sampling technique â€“ how to obtain a good sample
- How to get representative sample?
  - The only way to guarantee it is to make sure you covered all the data dimensions PLUS full data range for each data dimension
- Usually it means that you need lots of data points (the more the better)
- So, sampling technique is a science on its own
- Random sampling often returns the best results

## QUESTION: Your boss wants to calculate how much people spend on average on supermarket shopping in the UK.
You decide to stand by the exit of the nearest Asda and ask people who leave the shop how much they just spent. Name 5 reasons why this sample will NOT be representative.

HINT: do not include reasons that can be eliminated by standing by the exit long enough

(e.g. small sample size or people not answering can be resolved if you stay there longer)

- Looking at one brand only
- Geographical region
- On-line shoppers are excluded
- Date and time of the day/week/month/year (seasonal offers and pay date)
- Superstore vs Metro
- Local offers and promotions, like closing down sale
- people could also lie or round what they spent ~ but this gets eliminated

## Primary vs secondary data
### Primary
- collected yourself

### Secondary
- not doing it yourself
- so anything else than primary

#### Q: Which one is more reliable?
- It depends on the skillset, experience, and subject knowledge of whoever is doing it!

## Qualitative / quantitative data (aka categorical / continuous variables)
### Categorical (aka labels)
- Ordinal
- Nominal
- Binomial

### Continuous (aka numeric)
- True continuous data
- Discrete
- Intervals

**IMPORTANT: representing categorical values as numbers does NOT turn that into numeric variable**

## Types of analytics:
### Descriptive analytics

### Diagnostic analytics

### Predictive analytics

### Prescriptive analytics
